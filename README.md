# Mob Armor Trims
This mod makes mobs be able to spawn with naturally trimmed armor.

## What does the mod exactly do?
If a mob has an armor piece, it has a configurable chance (default is 50/50) of also having a completely random armor trim on its armor piece. This integrates minecrafts armor trims, which were added in 1.20, even further into the game.

## Clientside/Serverside
This mod is server-side.
