# Mob Armor Trims
This mod makes mobs be able to spawn with armor trims.

## What does the mod exactly do?
If a mob has an armor piece, it has a 50/50 chance of also having a completely random armor trim on its armor piece. This integrates minecrafts armor trims, which were added in 1.20, even further into the game.

##  Installation
To install the mod, you need to create a Fabric Instance. You can download the fabric installer [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)<br/>
Next download this mod and put it in your mods folder of your Fabric Instance.
The last step is to download the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/versions) and also put it in your mods folder. <br/>
Now you should be ready to launch the game and play with this game!
