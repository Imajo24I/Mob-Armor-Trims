# Mob Armor Trims
This mod makes mobs be able to spawn with armor trims.

## What does the mod exactly do?
If a mob has an armor piece, it has a 50/50 chance of also having a completely random armor trim on its armor piece. This integrates minecrafts armor trims, which were added in 1.20, even further into the game.

Support for the forge/neoforge/quilt modloaders may be added later
