# Mob Armor Trims
This mod makes mobs be able to spawn with naturally trimmed armor.

## What does the mod exactly do?
If a mob has armor, it also has a configurable chance of having armor trims on its armor piece. The armor trims are randomly choosen, while also taking the previous applied trims into account, creating good looking trim combinations.

## Clientside/Serverside
This mod is server-side.
