# Mob Armor Trims
This mod makes mobs be able to spawn with armor trims.

## What does the mod exactly do?
If a mob has an armor piece, it has a 50/50 chance of also having a completely random armor trim on its armor piece. This integrates minecrafts armor trims, which were added in 1.20, even further into the game.

##  Dependencies
This mod depends on the Modloader Fabric and the mod Fabric API.  
Support for the forge/neoforge/quilt modloaders may be added later

## Configure
You can configure this mod currently only through the config file in not yet released versions. This file is located in 

> .minecraft/config/mob-armor-trims.json  
 
Integration into the [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) mod is currently in development.
